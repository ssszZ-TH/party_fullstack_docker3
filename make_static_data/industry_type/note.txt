Looking for a dataset(s) containing NAICS, SIC, and DUNS codes
question
Currently working at a company that wants to build an internal tool to pull these codes for specific client companies we're working with. Does anyone know of any datasets that exist with this information? All I've found thus far are 3rd party products you have to pay for like https://www.naics.com/company-lookup-tool/. But they obviously got their data from somewhere right?

You might be looking for the NAICS to SIC crosswalk here (free download): https://www.naics.com/product/sic-naics-cross-references/

Census also has some files that could help: https://www.census.gov/naics/?48967

I'm pretty sure census has these codes somewhere. If not, try looking at other government sites

Those 3 are public and originally on gov sites except DUNS which is direct from Dun & Bradstreet.

Direct links:

NAICS - https://www.census.gov/naics/

SIC - https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/division-of-corporation-finance-standard-industrial-classification-sic-code-list

DUNS - https://www.dnb.com/duns.html

standardized company industry. Sometimes stuff gets grouped in.... a procrustean manner (think kmeans vs. dbscan), but for the most part it's pretty helpful, especially if you have augmentative data. There are a few industries that are a clusterfuck in there, you'll realize it pretty quickly. I do think there's an opporunity for some automation / ML / classification since the last time i worked with NAICs

Naic's?

I am not being smart here. I found someone a whooping cough dataset today once we worked out it was whooping cough not the medical term.

And having the common names helps people searching later. Btw what search terms have you used over r/datasets, as that could trigger some people for datasets they know already?

Naics and sic codes should be readily available for free, I think from some government website. It’s the gics industry codes I’ve had a hard time coming by.
